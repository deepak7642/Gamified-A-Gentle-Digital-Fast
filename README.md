## **Prototype Title - Gamified : A Gentle Digital Fast**

### **🎮 Welcome to the Gamified Digital Wellness Recommender**

_Our platform transforms healthy screen habits into a rewarding gameplay experience. Instead of collecting coins, users unlock real-life wellness challenges — screen-free breaks, social interactions, mindfulness moments, and more. 🌱_

🤖 Powered by an AI-driven Digital Wellness Profiler, the system assesses users’ digital usage patterns and classifies them into risk categories: Healthy, Mild Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, and Critical Risk.

🚀 Based on this profile, the app recommends personalized and fun tasks to help users restore balance, reduce stress, and build healthier digital habits.

**💡 In short: We turn mindful technology use into a game — making wellness enjoyable, motivating, and accessible for everyone.**

### **_What's next for Gamified Digital Wellness Recommender_** 

The journey doesn’t stop here — this is just the beginning. Moving forward, we aim to collect richer behavioral datasets to enhance personalization and improve our risk assessment accuracy. We plan to expand the gamified ecosystem with more challenge types, progress tracking, leaderboards, and reward mechanisms to keep users motivated long-term. We also envision integrating wearable and smartphone wellness APIs to detect stress or fatigue in real time, enabling proactive interventions. On the AI side, we hope to fine-tune our LLM for even safer, more empathetic recommendations tailored to each user’s emotional state. Finally, we want to scale our platform to schools, universities, and workplaces — helping people everywhere create healthier and happier relationships with technology. 🌍✨
